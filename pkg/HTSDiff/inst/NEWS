             ========================================


		CHANGES in HTSDiff VERSION 1.0.4-1.0.6
		
-- All genes are declared NDE if all clusters have a sufficiently small ratio
of lambda values (lambda_1 / lambda_2 < epsilon).
-- Completed vignette, and added to Windows menu.
-- Correction for baseMeanA and baseMeanB when a single replicate is available.
-- Minor change to documentation for syntheticData (thanks C.M.-R.!)
-- Bug fix to syntheticData.R (thanks M.-L. M.-M.!)


		CHANGES in HTSDiff VERSION 1.0.3
		
-- Corrected sign of BIC in nullLogLikeModel (thanks M.-L. Martin-Magniette!)
			 
			 
		CHANGES in HTSDiff VERSION 1.0.2

-- Updated dependency of HTSCluster to most recent version (2.0.3)
-- poisson.glm.mix added to imports for the use of the mylogLikePoisMix function
-- Created vignette template
-- Default normalization in nullModel is now "TMM" rather than "DESeq"
-- More informative output following EM algorithm: number of iterations
performed, the last value of the difference between successive log-likelihoods.


		CHANGES in HTSDiff VERSION 1.0.1

-- Fixed small bug leading to repeated gene IDs in HTSDiff results (thanks to Denis
Laloe for his sharp eye!).


		CHANGES in HTSDiff VERSION 1.0.0

This is the first release version (25 September 2013).


		CHANGES in HTSDiff VERSION 0.1.1

-- Added additional parameter control to HTSDiff function (e.g. number of iterations 
in small-EM initializations as well as epsilon as user-supplied cutoff), improved
output of HTSDiff function
-- Added initialDataset as data in package, as well as syntheticSims function to generate
synthetic data from initialDataset. Removed DEPoisMixSim function.
-- Moved edgeR to imports, update dependency of HTSCluster to version 1.99.0


		CHANGES in HTSDiff VERSION 0.1

This is the first development version (12 December 2012).
