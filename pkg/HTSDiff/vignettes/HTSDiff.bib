  pages = {1-28},
  number = {R106},
  comment = {Read count is linearly related to transcript abundance. DESeq similar
	to edgeR (Negative Binomial model), but the variance is assumed to
	be the sum of a shot noise and raw variance term, which is a smooth
	function (mean-dependent local regression) of the expected value
	of the true concentration of fragments from a particular gene (=
	pool data from genes with similar expression strength for variance
	estimation). Propose a similar method for determining the size factor
	(median of ratio of gene count to geometric mean across samples),
	similar to Oshlack and Robinson. Variance-stabilizing transformation
	for clustering.},

  pages = {1-28},
  number = {24},
  abstract = {"Our main point in the further development of statistical tools for
	differential expression from RNA-Seq, though, is that all three of
	the methods above [edgeR with trend, DESeq, NBP] improve substantially
	on the one that assumes constant dispersion parameter, that the differences
	between them are slight, and that the rapid and efficient development
	of RNA-Seq statistical tools will benefit from the competitive but
	cooperative study of teams following these different approaches."},
  comment = {NBP parameterization of the negative binomial distribution (over-parameterized:
	extra parameter alpha to describe mean-variance relationship). Good
	description of statistical challenges for RNA-seq data. Compare to
	Poisson, t-tests, limma, DESeq, edgeR. Simulations + Arabidopsis

  volume = {4},
  number = {14},
  comment = {Bias is due to increased variance for shorter transcripts and higher
	sampling for long genes compared to short genes -- we need a statistical
	framework that gives similar FDR for different transcript lengths.
	# of reads is proportional to length x expression ( = more power
	to detect differential expression for longer genes). Assessed effect
	on three previous studies (Sultan et al 1008, Cloonan et al 2008,
	Marioni et al 2008)
	
	Even normalizing by gene length does not alleviate the problem (as
	gene length still affects the variance of the estimate!) -- one suggestion
	is to use a fixed length window approach},
