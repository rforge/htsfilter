	outcome in RNA sequencing and other sequence-based comparative genomic
	experiments. RNA-sequencing data take the form of counts, so models
	based on the Gaussian distribution are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization
	is challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate
	quite different total numbers of reads. To overcome these difficulties,
	we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We
	derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR).
	Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or
	multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large
	data sets. We study the accuracy of our approaches for significance
	calculation and FDR estimation, and we demonstrate that our method
	has potential advantages over existing methods that are based on
	a Poisson or negative binomial model. In summary, this work provides
	a pipeline for the significance analysis of sequencing data.},
